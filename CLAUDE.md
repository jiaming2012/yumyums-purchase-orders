## Project

**Yumyums HQ — Operations Console**

A mobile-first PWA operations console for a food truck business. One app shell with a launcher grid linking to independent workflow tools. Each tool is a standalone HTML page inside a shared PWA, designed for a small crew (1-5 people) to use on their phones.

**Core Value:** A workflow engine that lets the owner build checklist templates and have crew members fill them out on mobile — with accountability and smart conditions.

### Current Tools

| Tool | Status | Route |
|------|--------|-------|
| Operations | Complete (v1.0) | workflows.html |
| Purchasing | Mockup | purchasing.html |
| Users | Mockup | users.html |
| Login | Screen | login.html |
| Payroll | Placeholder | — |
| Scheduling | Placeholder | — |
| Hiring | Placeholder | — |
| BI | Placeholder | — |

### Architecture

- **Shell:** `index.html` — launcher grid with emoji tiles, links to tool pages
- **Tools:** Each tool is a standalone HTML page with a back link to HQ
- **Workflows:** `workflows.html` — 3-tab layout (My Checklists / Approvals / Builder), ~1500 lines vanilla JS
- **PWA:** Single service worker (`sw.js`, cache version `yumyums-v39`) caches all pages
- **Auto-reload:** `ptr.js` listens for `controllerchange` to reload on new SW deploy
- **Manifest:** `manifest.json` — "Yumyums HQ", standalone display, portrait orientation
- **Styling:** Shared CSS variables with automatic dark mode, mobile-first (max-width 480px)
- **Testing:** 54 Playwright E2E tests in `tests/workflows.spec.js`
- **Backend design:** `docs/user-management-api.md` — 7 tables, REST API contracts, Go + Postgres

### workflows.html Key Concepts

- **State-first rendering:** Mutate JS state → call render function → DOM updates from state
- **Event delegation:** ONE click + ONE input listener per container div, routes via `data-action` attributes
- **MOCK_TEMPLATES:** Array of template objects with sections, fields, conditions, sub-steps
- **MOCK_RESPONSES:** Flat dict of field responses keyed by field ID
- **FAIL_NOTES / REJECTION_FLAGS / PENDING_APPROVALS / APPROVED_SUBMISSIONS:** In-memory state dicts
- **SortableJS 1.15.7:** Only external dependency, loaded via CDN for drag-to-reorder

### Adding a New Tool

1. Create `toolname.html` with the shared CSS variables and a back link to `index.html`
2. Add a tile to the grid in `index.html` (change `tile soon` to `tile active` with an `<a>` tag)
3. Add the new file to the `ASSETS` array in `sw.js` and bump the cache version
4. Run `npm test` to verify no regressions

## Conventions

- Static HTML/CSS/JS only — no build step, no framework
- Minified inline CSS in each page (shared variable block at top)
- Dark mode via CSS variables and `prefers-color-scheme` media query
- Double-tap zoom prevention via `dblclick` event listener
- Service worker uses cache-first strategy with offline fallback to index.html
- **SW cache must be bumped before every deploy and human-verify checkpoint**
- Event delegation in workflows.html (not inline onclick on dynamic elements)
- `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants, `camelCase` for functions
- Playwright E2E tests: `npm test` (headless) or `npm run test:headed`

## Project

**Yumyums HQ — Operations Console**

A mobile-first PWA operations console for a food truck business. One app shell with a launcher grid that links to independent workflow tools — purchasing, user management, and a workflow/checklist engine inspired by Lumiform. Each tool is a standalone HTML page inside a shared PWA, designed for a small crew (1-5 people) to use on their phones.

**Core Value:** A workflow engine that lets the owner build checklist templates and have crew members fill them out on mobile — with accountability (who checked what) and smart conditions (day-of-week, fail triggers, skip logic).

### Constraints

- **Static only:** No build step, no framework — plain HTML, CSS, vanilla JS (matches existing convention)
- **PWA:** Must work as installed app on iOS and Android, offline-capable via service worker
- **Mobile-first:** All UI designed for 480px max-width, touch-optimized
- **Design consistency:** Must use existing CSS variables and dark mode support from other HQ pages
- **Mocks only:** All data is hardcoded JavaScript arrays — no localStorage, no API calls

## Technology Stack

## Languages
- HTML5 - All UI pages (`index.html`, `login.html`, `purchasing.html`, `users.html`)
- JavaScript (vanilla, ES6+) - Inline scripts in all HTML pages and `ptr.js`
- CSS (inline, custom properties) - All styling inline within HTML `<style>` blocks
- Go - Backend API server (per `README.md` and `docs/user-management-api.md`)
- SQL (PostgreSQL) - Data persistence (per `README.md`)
## Runtime
- Browser (no server-side runtime currently; pure static files)
- Service Worker runtime (`sw.js`) for PWA offline caching
- None - zero build tooling; no `package.json`, no lockfile
- Files are served directly as static assets
## Frameworks
- None - plain HTML, vanilla JavaScript, and CSS custom properties
- No frontend framework (no React, Vue, Angular, HTMX, etc. — HTMX is planned per README but not yet present)
- Web App Manifest (`manifest.json`) - install prompt and standalone display mode
- Service Worker (`sw.js`, cache version `yumyums-v5`) - shell-only offline caching
- None detected - no test files, no test framework
- None - no build step; deploy is direct static file serving
## Key Dependencies
- Cache API (`caches`) - service worker shell caching in `sw.js`
- `navigator.serviceWorker` - PWA registration in all HTML pages
- `navigator.standalone` / `matchMedia('display-mode: standalone')` - iOS standalone detection in `ptr.js`
## Configuration
- No environment variables (static frontend only)
- No `.env` file present
- None - no build config files
- Deployment config: `.do/app.yaml` (Digital Ocean App Platform spec)
- Cache key in `sw.js`: `const CACHE = 'yumyums-v5'` — must be bumped manually on deploy to invalidate cached assets
- Cached assets list: `['./','./index.html','./purchasing.html','./users.html','./login.html','./ptr.js','./manifest.json']`
## Platform Requirements
- Any HTTP server (HTTPS required for iOS PWA install prompt and service worker)
- No local tooling required — files can be opened directly or served with `python3 -m http.server`
- Static file host with HTTPS
- Currently: Digital Ocean App Platform (static site), auto-deploy on push to `main` branch of GitHub repo `jiaming2012/yumyums-purchase-orders`
- Live URL: `https://yumyums-purchase-orders-4iuwf.ondigitalocean.app`
- Planned production: Hetzner box with Caddy reverse proxy at `order.yumyums.com`
## Planned Backend Stack (not yet built)
- **Language:** Go
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (separate schema on existing Hetzner box)
- **Reverse proxy:** Caddy (automatic Let's Encrypt HTTPS)
- **Scheduling:** Go stdlib `cron` / `time.AfterFunc` (not Temporal)
- **Auth:** Bearer token sessions, password hash in DB, invite token flow
- **API base:** `/api/v1` (REST, JSON)
- **Frontend upgrade:** Plain HTML + HTMX (no build step retained)

## Overview
## Naming Patterns
- All lowercase, no separators: `index.html`, `purchasing.html`, `users.html`, `login.html`, `sw.js`, `ptr.js`
- HTML pages named after their feature/module (one page = one feature)
- Utility JS named by function: `ptr.js` (pull-to-refresh), `sw.js` (service worker)
- Short, abbreviated names preferred: `.hd` (header), `.nm` (name), `.em` (email), `.mut` (muted), `.brd` (border), `.txt` (text), `.bg` (background)
- BEM-adjacent for variants: `.pill`, `.pill-admin`, `.pill-manager`, `.pill-member`, `.pill-invited`, `.pill-config`
- State modifier using `.on` for active tab button: `button.on`
- Layout helpers: `.card`, `.row`, `.hd`, `.ft`, `.grid`, `.tabs`
- `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for module-level data constants: `CATS`, `USERS`, `APPS`, `DEFAULT_PERMS`, `USER_GRANTS`, `CACHE`, `ASSETS`
- camelCase for functions: `pillClass()`, `pillText()`, `buildAccess()`, `togglePerm()`, `addGrant()`, `removeGrant()`, `editUser()`, `clearEdit()`, `sendInvite()`, `resetPw()`, `deleteUser()`, `show()`
- Single-letter locals inside loops and lambdas: `u` (user), `d` (div), `r` (row), `n` (number), `e` (event), `k` (cache key), `h` (element), `c` (cache)
- Semantic kebab-like IDs: `user-list`, `edit-title`, `extern-notice`, `edit-fields`, `back-hint`, `btn-invite`, `btn-reset`, `btn-delete`, `f-email`, `f-role`
- Dynamic IDs use prefix + slug pattern: `s1`, `s2`, `s3` (sections), `t1`, `t2`, `t3` (tabs), `pick-${app.slug}`, `access-${app.slug}`
## Code Style
- No formatter configured. Inline styles and scripts are heavily minified/compacted.
- CSS rules are written single-line with no spaces: `:root{--bg:#f5f5f3;--card:#fff;...}`
- JS inside `<script>` tags is compact — no blank lines, short variable names, arrow functions
- Standalone `.js` files (e.g., `ptr.js`) use slightly more readable formatting with newlines
## Import Organization
## HTML Structure Pattern
## DOM Manipulation
- Direct DOM API: `document.getElementById()`, `document.createElement()`, `el.appendChild()`
- Template strings for innerHTML when building lists: `` el.innerHTML = `<div class="nm">${u.name}</div>` ``
- Event handlers attached as `.onclick =` properties or inline `onclick="fn()"` attributes
- No event delegation pattern — each element gets its own handler
## Data Patterns
- Static in-memory data defined as `const` arrays/objects at the top of each script block
- Data is hard-coded (mock/prototype state) — no fetch calls or API integration yet
- Array of tuples used for compact data: `['Salmon fillet','lb','par 6',3]`
- Array of objects for richer data: `{id:1,name:'Jamal M.',email:'jamal@yumyums.com',role:'superadmin',status:'config'}`
## UI State Management
- Tab visibility controlled by `show(n)` function pattern — iterates `[1,2,3]` and toggles `style.display`
- Form state held in module-level `let editingUser = null` variable
- No state library; all state is in-page JS variables and the DOM
## Error Handling
- No error handling for DOM operations
- Form validation is minimal: `if(!email) return;`
- Mock actions use `alert()` and `confirm()` built-ins
- Service worker fetch failures fall back to `caches.match('./index.html')`
## Comments
- Comments are sparse. Used only for section headers in longer files:
- HTML section markers used in `users.html`:
- Production intention noted in comments: `// In production this will POST to /api/v1/auth/login`
## Function Design
- Functions are short and focused on a single DOM action
- Functions named after their action: `show()`, `editUser()`, `clearEdit()`, `sendInvite()`, `buildAccess()`
- `buildAccess()` is the most complex function — rebuilds the entire access tab DOM from scratch on each state change (no diffing)
- Parameters are positional, minimal: `show(n)`, `togglePerm(slug, role, val)`, `addGrant(slug)`, `removeGrant(slug, uid)`
## PWA Boilerplate (repeated on every page)
<!-- GSD:conventions-end -->

<!-- GSD:architecture-start source:ARCHITECTURE.md -->
## Architecture

## Pattern Overview
- One installable PWA icon that acts as a launcher for multiple operational tools
- Each tool is a fully self-contained HTML page — no shared JS module system, no framework
- All data is currently hardcoded mock state in inline `<script>` blocks; no backend exists yet
- Single service worker provides cache-first offline coverage across all pages
- No build step, no bundler, no package manager
## Layers
- Purpose: Home screen that links to each tool; the "one icon on the phone" entry point
- Location: `index.html`
- Contains: 2×3 tile grid with emoji icons, active links for live tools, "Soon" placeholders for future tools
- Depends on: `sw.js` (for PWA install), `ptr.js` (pull-to-refresh), `manifest.json`
- Used by: Users navigating from home screen
- Purpose: Each operational workflow, standalone and independently navigable
- Location: `purchasing.html`, `users.html`, `login.html`
- Contains: All CSS (inlined), all JS (inline `<script>` block), HTML structure for that workflow
- Depends on: `ptr.js` (shared behavior), `sw.js` (cached), `manifest.json`
- Used by: Shell tiles linking to them; users bookmarking directly
- Purpose: Behavior shared across every page
- Location: `ptr.js`
- Contains: Pull-to-refresh gesture handler (iOS standalone PWA only — Android has it natively)
- Depends on: Nothing
- Used by: All pages via `<script src="ptr.js">`
- Purpose: PWA offline support, cache management
- Location: `sw.js`
- Contains: Install (pre-cache all assets), activate (purge stale caches), fetch (cache-first with offline fallback to `index.html`)
- Depends on: Cache version string `CACHE = 'yumyums-v5'` — must be bumped manually on deploys
- Used by: Browser; registered from every page
## Data Flow
- No framework state management; plain JS variables in page scope
- `editingUser` variable in `users.html` tracks which user is being edited
- `DEFAULT_PERMS` and `USER_GRANTS` objects in `users.html` are mutated directly on toggle/add/remove actions
## Key Abstractions
- Purpose: Implicit interface every tool page follows
- Pattern: Each page must include: shared CSS variable block, `<meta viewport>` with zoom disabled, back link to `index.html`, `sw.js` registration, `ptr.js` script tag
- Examples: `purchasing.html`, `users.html`, `login.html`
- Purpose: Navigation unit on the home screen
- Two variants: `<a class="tile active" href="...">` for live tools, `<div class="tile soon">` with `<span class="badge">Soon</span>` for placeholders
- Location: `index.html` lines 39–78
- Purpose: In-page navigation between views within a tool
- Pattern: `<div class="tabs">` containing `<button>` elements, `show(n)` JS function controls visibility of `id="s1"`, `id="s2"`, `id="s3"` sections
- Used in: `purchasing.html` (Form / Locked / PO), `users.html` (Users / Edit / Access)
- Purpose: Central list of all tools and their slugs used for permission management
- Location: `users.html` inline `<script>`, `APPS` array
- Pattern: `{slug, name, icon}` — slug matches the tool route name; permissions keyed off slug
## Entry Points
- Location: `index.html`
- Triggers: User launches installed PWA, or navigates to root URL
- Responsibilities: Renders tile grid, registers service worker, links to tools
- Location: `login.html`
- Triggers: Not yet gated — login page exists but no auth middleware enforces it
- Responsibilities: Collect email + password; planned to POST to `/api/v1/auth/login`
- Location: `purchasing.html`
- Triggers: Tapping the Purchasing tile from `index.html`
- Responsibilities: Weekly order form (stepper inputs per catalog item), locked view, PO summary by vendor
- Location: `users.html`
- Triggers: Tapping the Users tile from `index.html`
- Responsibilities: Team member list, invite/edit user form, per-app role and individual grant management
- Location: `sw.js`
- Triggers: Registered by every page on load; browser-managed lifecycle
- Responsibilities: Pre-caches all HTML assets on install, serves cache-first on fetch, falls back to `index.html` on network error
## Error Handling
- Login form: renders error div with class `show` on bad input (always fires in current mock)
- Purchasing stepper: min-clamp at 0 (cannot go below zero)
- Access grants: guards against duplicate adds with `if(!USER_GRANTS[slug].includes(uid))`
- No network error handling (planned for production handlers)
## Cross-Cutting Concerns
<!-- GSD:architecture-end -->

<!-- GSD:workflow-start source:GSD defaults -->
## GSD Workflow Enforcement

Before using Edit, Write, or other file-changing tools, start work through a GSD command so planning artifacts and execution context stay in sync.

Use these entry points:
- `/gsd:quick` for small fixes, doc updates, and ad-hoc tasks
- `/gsd:debug` for investigation and bug fixing
- `/gsd:execute-phase` for planned phase work

Do not make direct repo edits outside a GSD workflow unless the user explicitly asks to bypass it.
