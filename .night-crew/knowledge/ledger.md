- **2026-07-09 — Purchasing hardening-PRD card shape → (a) enumerate + mark as a real app.**
  Fork was queued in the roadmap on the premise Purchasing is a bare mockup. That
  premise is stale: `backend/internal/purchasing/*` (~20 endpoints: orders, shopping
  lists, cutoff, suggestions, repurchase-reset + scheduler), `purchasing.html` (1,078 L),
  and `tests/purchasing.spec.js` (31 KB) are real and tested. Resolution: treat Purchasing
  like the other four apps — its PRD copies the Operations exemplar and honestly marks
  WORKING/UNPROVEN/BROKEN (confirmed-only-BROKEN). Rejected (b) out-of-scope (would hole the
  5/5 Product KR-1 denominator) and (c) thin stub (dishonest given real code). Slated on
  `overnight-20260710`. *Rationale: enumerate against what the build actually surfaces.*
