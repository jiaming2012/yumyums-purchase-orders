# Card actuals — cycle-time ledger

> **Purpose:** the empirical basis future slates size against. This slate
> (`overnight-20260710`) is the **first** — there was no prior ledger, so its
> estimates were wide first-of-kind ranges. These are the first real data points.
> **What one "card" covers:** draft (2 enumeration passes) → G6 adversarial review
> → any REVISE loop → orchestrator commit + roadmap flip. Wall-clock, orchestrated
> serially by one control loop dispatching fresh subagents per card.
> **Caveat (read before using these to size):** these actuals are **subagent
> wall-clock**, not human-drafting time. They came in **6–10× under** the slate's
> first-of-kind estimates (which implicitly assumed human-paced drafting). The
> *ratio between cards* (Inventory ≈ 1.5× the small cards) is the more transferable
> signal than the absolute minutes.

## Run: overnight-20260710 (Activity 1 — enumerate & mark PRD cards)

| Card | Est. (slate) | Actual (wall-clock) | Passes | G6 verdict | Draft→G6→revise breakdown |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `users-hardening-prd` | 30–55 min | **8m 20s** | 2 | REVISE→pass | draft 3m16s · G6 1m07s · revise 2m00s |
| `onboarding-hardening-prd` | 45–75 min | **9m 48s** | 2 | REVISE→pass | draft 4m14s · G6 1m54s · revise 2m03s |
| `purchasing-hardening-prd` | 45–75 min | **8m 02s** | 2 | REVISE→pass | draft 3m58s · G6 1m06s · revise 1m03s |
| `inventory-hardening-prd` | 60–110 min | **11m 48s** | 2 | ACCEPT (1st pass) | draft 8m29s · G6 1m46s · no revise |
| **Total (4 cards, serial)** | 3.5–5 h | **~38 min** | — | 3 REVISE + 1 ACCEPT | — |

## First-slate observations (seed for next cycle's sizing)

- **Absolute minutes are not portable.** All four cards finished 6–10× under
  first-of-kind estimates. Do not carry the raw minutes forward as a budget; carry
  the *shape*.
- **Surface size tracks draft time, weakly.** Inventory (2498 L HTML, 40 reqs,
  154 KB spec) drafted in ~8.5 min vs ~3–4 min for the small apps — ~2× the draft
  time for ~1.5× the requirement count. Draft time scales sub-linearly with surface
  because the subagent parallel-reads; G6 time is near-flat (~1–2 min) regardless.
- **REVISE loops are cheap but common.** 3 of 4 cards took one REVISE round
  (~1–2 min each). The revises were *bookkeeping*, never re-enumeration: a status
  mis-mark (Users), tally arithmetic (Onboarding), a route-count typo (Purchasing).
  Budget one short revise round per card by default; a clean first-pass ACCEPT
  (Inventory) is the exception, not the rule.
- **The load-bearing gate was G6 tally/status scrutiny, not draft depth.** Every
  REVISE came from the adversarial reviewer catching an internal inconsistency the
  drafter's own report asserted was clean. Keep G6 fresh-context and separate.
