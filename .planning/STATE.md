# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-15)

**Core value:** Operational tools that let the owner manage crew workflows and training from one mobile app — with accountability and smart conditions.
**Current focus:** v2.0 Backend — Phase 9: Foundation + Auth

## Current Position

Phase: 9 of 12 (Foundation + Auth)
Plan: — (not yet planned)
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-04-15 — v2.0 roadmap created, Phase 9 ready

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0% (v2.0 milestone)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 18 (v1.0 + v1.1)
- Average duration: ~12 min
- Total execution time: ~3.6 hours

**By Phase (v2.0):**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 09-foundation-auth | TBD | - | - |
| 10-workflows-api | TBD | - | - |
| 11-onboarding-users-admin | TBD | - | - |
| 12-inventory-photos | TBD | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans (v1.1): 5, 20, 25, 3, 30 min
- Trend: Variable

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v2.0 roadmap]: httpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict cookies — NOT localStorage — for session tokens (XSS risk; iOS standalone partition breaks localStorage anyway)
- [v2.0 roadmap]: Same-origin serving — Go binary embeds frontend via embed.FS, serves both `/api/v1/*` and static files from same host — eliminates CORS entirely
- [v2.0 roadmap]: IndexedDB + `online` event for offline queue — NOT Background Sync API (zero iOS Safari support)
- [v2.0 roadmap]: SW fetch handler must be partitioned before first API call — network-first for `/api/*`, cache-first for static (SW cache-first would corrupt API responses)
- [v2.0 roadmap]: DO Spaces presigned PUT URLs for photos — Go server generates URL, browser uploads directly; server never touches file bytes
- [v2.0 roadmap]: goose migrations — one logical change per numbered file, each in BEGIN/COMMIT — prevents dirty state on startup

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Email provider must be chosen before Phase 9 planning — Resend vs Postmark vs net/smtp (affects invite flow in Phase 9)
- Onboarding schema not in docs/user-management-api.md — must be designed at Phase 11 planning by inspecting onboarding.html data structures
- DO Spaces bucket CORS policy for direct browser PUT uploads must be verified during Phase 12 planning
- Auth must be tested on a physical iPhone in standalone mode before Phase 9 is declared done — not in Safari or Chrome DevTools
